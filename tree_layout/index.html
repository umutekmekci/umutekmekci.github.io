    <h1>How to layout a tree</h1>
    <p>In this article, I will try to explain how we can draw a tree to the screen when we have a tree structure in json format.
    </p>
    <p>
        In general, there are two strategies, the first is to draw the leaves at the same level, 
        and the second is to draw the nodes that have the same parent at the same level.
    </p>
    <p>
        Lets see the difference between two strategies.
    </p>
    <div id="first-draw">
        <svg width="500" height="500" id="same-leaf"></svg>
        <svg width="500" height="500" id="same-level"></svg>
    </div>
    <p>
        Throughout the article we will focus on the following tree structure.
    </p>
    <div id="small-tree">
        <svg width="1000" height="250" id="small-tree-svg"></svg>
    </div>
    <p>
        In the first structure leafs are aligned and in the second structure nodes that have same parent are aligned.
        Each 2 by 3 or 3 by 2 rectangle above represents a tree. The height represents the level of the tree and width is equal to the maximum number of children a node have.
        For example, any node of the tree corresponding to the first shape has a maximum of two children and its has 3 levels.

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="solution">We will start building the solution from the leafs and when we encounter a node that is not a leaf we will let this parent node to decide the layout of its children.
        Because only parent node knows the solutions of each child node and can combine these solutions into the desired solution. </span>
        <br>Lets see the code that makes this happen.
    </p>
    <div class="code">

        def make_leafs_same_level(self, H, children): <br>
        &nbsp for child in children: <br>
        &nbsp &nbsp child.ty = H - child.H + 1 <br><br>

        def evaluate_results(self, results): <br>
        &nbsp l = len(results)  <br>
        &nbsp W = 0  <br>
        &nbsp H = 0  <br>
        &nbsp for res in results: <br>
        &nbsp &nbsp width, height = res <br>
        &nbsp &nbsp W += width <br>
        &nbsp &nbsp H = max(H, height) <br>
        &nbsp return W, H <br><br>

    def _layout(self, node): <br>
    &nbsp results = [] <br>
    &nbsp if node.children is not None: <br>
    &nbsp &nbsp   for child in node.children: <br>
    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  W, H = self._layout(child) <br>
    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp child.W = W <br>
    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp child.H = H <br>
    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp results.append((W, H)) <br>
    &nbsp width, height = self.evaluate_results(results) <br>
    &nbsp self.make_leafs_same_level(height, node.children) <br>
    &nbsp self.calc_tx(width, node.children) <br>
    &nbsp return width + 1 if width == 0 else width, height + 1 <br>
    </div>
    <p>
       make_leafs_same_level function aligns the bottom of the rectangles, which is exactly what we defined above. <br>
       calc_tx calculates the relative positions of each child node according to its parent. Lets see it definition 
    </p> 
    <div class="code">

        def calc_tx(self, W, children): <br>
        &nbsp middle = W / 2 <br>
        &nbsp s = 0 <br>
        &nbsp for child in children: <br>
        &nbsp &nbsp    x = s + child.W / 2 <br>
        &nbsp &nbsp    child.tx = x-middle <br>
        &nbsp &nbsp    s = s + child.W <br>
    </div>
    <p>
        <span class="solution">Keeping the information of how much each node will translate relative to its parent will make it very easy for us to draw the nodes, 
        because once the root node is placed, all the nodes will automatically adjust themselves according to their parent. </span>
    </p>
    <p>
        The drawing logic is easy as seen below.
    </p>
    <div class="code">

        function draw(tree, parent_selection) <br>
        &nbsp const g = parent_selection.append("g") <br>
        &nbsp .attr("transform",`translate(${tree.tx * gxs}, ${tree.ty * gys})`) <br> <br>
    
        &nbsp const r = 20 <br>
        &nbsp const circ = g.append("circle") <br>
        &nbsp .attr("cx", 0) <br>
        &nbsp .attr("cy", 0) <br>
        &nbsp .attr("r", r) <br>
        &nbsp .attr("stroke", "red") <br>
        &nbsp .attr("fill", "rgba(0,0,0,0)") <br> <br>

        &nbsp for(i = 0; i&#60;tree.children.length; i++){  <br>
            &nbsp &nbsp     draw(tree.children[i], g)  <br>
        } <br>
    </div>    
    <p>
        As always you can see the full code in the source file of this article.
