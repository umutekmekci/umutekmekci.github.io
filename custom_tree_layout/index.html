        <h1>Tree Customization</h1>
        <p>
            In part 1, we drew a tree on the screen.
            In this article we will look at how we can customize this tree.
        </p>
            The first feature we will add is draggability. <br>
            Although it seems difficult, it is an easy feature because the tree structure is recursive.
            Considering that we draw the tree based on the distance of each node relative to its parent, 
            what we need to do here is to find the new distances of the dragged node relative to its parent and 
            call the recursive draw function for this node.
        </p>
        <div class="code">
            let drag = d3.drag() <br>
            .on('drag', function(event, d){  <br>
                &nbsp    self._tx += event.dx  <br>
                &nbsp    self._ty += event.dy  <br>
                &nbsp    self.render(parent, index, isroot, render_text, EditInput, EditButton) <br>
            })
        </div>   
        <p>
            Another feature I will mention is adding a new node which is almost same as dragging. We just need to create a new node, add it to the child list of its parent and render the tree starting from the parent node.
        </p>
        <div class="code">
            .on("contextmenu", function(ev){  <br>
                &nbsp    ev.preventDefault();  <br>
                &nbsp    const new_node = new Node()  <br>
                &nbsp    new_node.tx(50).ty(25).txt(["new title"]) <br>
                &nbsp    self._children.push(new_node)  <br>
                &nbsp    self.render(parent, index, isroot, render_text, EditInput, EditButton) <br> 
            })
        </div>
        <p>
            The last feature I will mention is downloading the tree as png file. The logic is svg --> blob --> img --> canvas and save the canvas.
            You can see how it is done in the click action of download button.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is a sample tree that I have uploaded below, you can see how these functions work on this tree. <br> <br>
            Go a head and drag any node to see the drag effect, you can double click any text to change it, right click on any parent will create a new child node, and also you can press download to download the tree as a png file.
