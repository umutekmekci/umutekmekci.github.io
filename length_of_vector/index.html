        In my previous article, I talked about wedge and dot products and how these two products are complementary to each other. What I didn't mention is that when these two products come together they form the geometric product.
        <p>
             \( ab = a \wedge b + a \cdot b \) 
        </p>
        <p>
             where \( a \), \( b \) are vectors. For some special cases such as when \( a \) and \( b \) are orthogonal geometric product is \( ab = a \wedge b \) and
             when  \( a \) and \( b \) are parallel geometric product is \( ab = a \cdot b \) 
        </p>
        <p>
            We know that square length of a vector \( c \) is its dot product with itself \( c \cdot c \) which is also its geometric product with itself \( cc \).
        </p>

        <p>
            \( c = a + b \) 
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to find the square length of \( c \) we can calculate \(  cc \) geometric product of \( c \) by itself.
        </p>
        <p>
            \(  cc = (a+b)(a+b) = aa + ab + ba + bb \)  &nbsp where \( ab = a \wedge b + a \cdot b \) &nbsp and &nbsp \( ba = b \wedge a + b \cdot a \)
        </p>
        <p>
            We know from the previous article that \( a \wedge b = -b \wedge a \)  so terms \( a \wedge b \) and \( b \wedge a \) cancels each other and
        </p>
        <p>
            \( cc = a \cdot a + b \cdot b + 2 a \cdot b \).
        </p>
        <p>
            The square length of vector \( c \) is is the sum of square length of vectors \( a \), \( b \) and their dot product.
        </p>
        <p>
            In case \( a \) and \( b \) are orthogonal, their dot product is zero so square length of \( c \) is just
        </p>
        <p>
            \( cc = aa + bb  == |c|^2 = |a|^2 + |b|^2 \)
        </p>
